description: I2CHUB02 is low voltage I2C multiplexer (hub) which allows you to divide
  I2C bus into 8 separate buses, where the user can switch and connect individual
  sub-bus differently. This can connect multiple I2Cs to the device, change the voltage
  levels, or disconnect a certain part of the bus when it is stuck.
